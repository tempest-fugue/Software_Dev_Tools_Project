# Software_Dev_Tools_Project
I clean the data from vehicles_us.csv in the EDA.ipynb file in notebooks to fill in null values, delete outliers, create some initial histograms, and add a 'manufacturer' field. The cleaned dataframe is exported to the csv file "vehicles_us_clean.csv"

I then use the streamlit library and the Render software to create visualizations for the Render app of the data and interfield relationships in the file vehicles_us_clean.csv. The end result are several interactive and dynamic graphs of this vehicle data.
